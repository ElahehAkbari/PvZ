# PvZ
This project is an implementation of Plants vs. Zombies written in Java using swing and graphics 2D. Plants vs. Zombies is a tower defense video game, the player takes the role of a homeowner amid a zombie apocalypse. As a horde of zombies approaches along several parallel lanes, the player must defend the home by putting down plants, which fire projectiles at the zombies or otherwise detrimentally affect them. The player collects a currency called sun to buy plants. If a zombie happens to make it to the house on any lane, the player must play through the level again.
